# Ecommerce

In this Ecommerce website, I have built a Home-page, Shop-page(Product listing page), and an About-page. On the Home-page all the products will be visible, while on the Shop-page user can add items to the cart and whether the user wants to increase or decrease the items can also be done. With filter options based on category, price range, and ratings.

In the cart page whenever the user adds the item to the cart it gets updated immediately. You can see all the products that the user has selected are visible in the cart with a Total price as well.

Then you have a form to submit the details for shipping the products with a payment option as well.

In this website, I have used React + TypeScript + Vite as a tech stack
